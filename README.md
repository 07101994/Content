# Microsoft Azure for Startups

This GitHub repository provides instructional guides and code packets to help startups quickly engage and get up and running on key Azure services.


##Topic summaries
### Getting Started on Azure video series
 - **[Overview of the Azure Console] ()** - Tutorial providing an introduction to the Azure Console
 - **[Virtual Network] ()** - Tutorial describing how to set up a virtual network
 - **[Resource Groups] ()** - Tutorial describing what to consider and how to create and manage a Resource Group
 - **[Storage Accounts] ()** - Tutorial describing how to create and manage a storage account and to select the storage option that is right for you.  Setting up a storage account is a precursor to setting up a virtual machine.
 - **[Virtual Machines] ()** - Tutorial describing how to set up a virtual network
 
### Azure services Instruction guides and code packets
- **[Azure IoT] (Instructional-guides-and-code-packets/Azure-IoT)** - This tutorial provides an end-to-end demonstration of the IoT sample system on Azure which includes: IoT hub for communication with devices, Stream Analytic for data analysis and aggregation, Azure SQL database for storage of the aggregated information and Power BI for visualization. 

- **[Azure Search] (Instructional-guides-and-code-packets/Azure-Search)** - This sample provides an end-to-end demo of how to conduct context searches of BLOB files using Azure Search indexing.  This is a common scenario for large Azure Web app log files that are stored in BLOB file storage.  You’ll create an Azure Search index for container content and a simple web client to search across this Azure Search index.

- **[Amazon S3 to Azure Blob Storage migration] (Instructional-guides-and-code-packets/Amazon-S3-to-Azure-Blog-Storage)** - This tutorial illustrates the basic principles of copying data from Amazon S3 to Azure storage. 

- **[Azure Machine Learning] (Instructional-guides-and-code-packets/Azure-Machine-Learning)** - This tutorial demonstrates how to apply Azure Machine Learning technology to perform analysis of a dummy system in order to detect and alert about any anomaly or unusual behavior. You will build a Machine Learning model/experiment for the system which performs data transfers between different Azure datacenters. You will also build a watchdog to monitor data transfer response time. 

- **[Azure Service Fabric] (Instructional-guides-and-code-packets/Azure-Service-Fabric)** - This sample covers a typical flow to perform heavy computational tasks – video encoding using ffmpeg library based on Azure Service Fabric micro-services platform. We describe how to build, deploy, scale and test your solution on Azure Service Fabric.

- **[Containers on Dockers] (Instructional-guides-and-code-packets/Containers-on-Dockers)** - This sample covers a typical flow to perform heavy computational tasks (for example video or audio encoding, hash calculation, data encryption, etc.) and demonstrates how to make this process scalable and cost effective using Docker containers.

- **[Media Services] (Instructional-guides-and-code-packets/Media-Services)** - This tutorial provides an end-to-end demonstration of the video hosting system on Azure which includes: Azure Storage, Azure Media Services, Azure SQL database, and Azure Web application as a frontend.

- **[Notification Hub] (Instructional-guides-and-code-packets/Notification-Hub)** - This tutorial and associated code sample illustrate how to use the Azure Notification Hub to deliver push notification messages to mobile applications on iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms.
